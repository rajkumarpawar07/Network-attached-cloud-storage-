Network attached cloud storage  using raspberry pi (NAS)
NAS is used to provide centralized storage for data that distributed teams, such as remote 
workers, need to access, and can act as a private cloud to give multiple users access to data 
on multiple hard drives. It is also used in larger enterprises as a backup target using NAS 
arrays, and for small virtualization environments for VMs.
